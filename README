The app was adapted by David Carpenter <caprenter@gmail.com> and is based on:

==== ShowMyPlings ==== 

Plings is a project to share data about positive activities for young people in the UK (www.plings.co.uk)

Visualising that data is something anyone can do using the Plings API to grab raw XML data.

ShowMyPlings is an application to make it easier to view XML data generated by Plings. It is really aimed at developers in order to provide quick visual feedback for their progress in working to get data into the system through the API.

This web application is licensed as free software so that people can take it and use it the way they want. See the LICENCE document for details.

The developer hub for the project can be found at http://www.plings.info/
